    Description: run `rbw get` in parallel to set environment variables to pass
    and execute another program.

    The [:::] argument can be repeated to fetch secrets with "rbwwget" in
    parallel for as many entries as required to pass to <command>.

    The terms "seed" and "field" are as defined by the "rbw" rust bitwarden
    client.

    A seed is required. If the default entry returned by "rbw get" is what is
    desired you must specify the environment variable name to set for the
    command by specifying "varname" and leaving "field" empty.
    Ex: api.prod::API_SECRET

    If "field" is given, its name will be used as the variable name passed,
    unless "varname" is set, which will override the "field" name.
    Ex: api.prod:test_account:API_SECRET
